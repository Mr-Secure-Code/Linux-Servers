# Linux Feature.

-   **Open Source**
    
    Open source means that its source code is available to the public and can be modified and distributed freely. This is in contrast to proprietary operating systems, which are owned by a company and are not available for users to view or modify.

-   **Multitasking**

    It is capable of running multiple programs or processes at the same time. This is made possible by the kernel, the core of the operating system, which is responsible for managing the system's resources and scheduling tasks to be run by the CPU.
-   **Reliability**

    A reliable system is one that is dependable and can be trusted to work consistently and correctly. This is especially important for systems that are used in mission-critical or safety-critical applications, where a failure could have serious consequences.
